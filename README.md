## Project Overview

This Agile planning project was completed as part of IBM’s *Introduction to Agile Development and Scrum* course on Coursera. The objective was to simulate a full product sprint using GitHub Projects by creating a structured backlog, prioritizing user stories, managing a sprint cycle, and moving issues through a Kanban board.

**Scenario:**  
Build the backend product catalog feature for an e-commerce platform, including CRUD operations, like/dislike functionality, filtering, and cloud deployment.

## Stakeholder Requirements (User Stories)

| Status           | User Story |
|------------------|------------|
| Sprint 1         | Add a product to the catalog |
| Sprint 1         | Search/filter products |
| Sprint 1         | Cloud hosting |
| Sprint 1         | Auto-deploy changes |
| Product Backlog  | Update product details |
| Product Backlog  | Delete product |
| Product Backlog  | Like a product |
| Product Backlog  | Dislike a product |
| Product Backlog  | View all products |
| Icebox           | Retrieve product by ID |

## Sprint Simulation

User stories were moved step-by-step through the following workflow:  
Sprint Backlog → In Progress → Review/QA → Done

- Sprint Backlog: 4 Issues (executed)
- Product Backlog: 5 Issues (ready)
- Icebox: 1 Issue (unscheduled)

---

## Agile Practices Demonstrated

- GitHub Kanban board with custom columns
- User story development using stakeholder requirements
- Gherkin-style acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
- Sprint prioritization and backlog refinement
- Manual sprint execution flow with column transitions
