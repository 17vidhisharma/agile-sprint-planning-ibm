# Agile Sprint Planning — IBM DevOps Capstone

IBM DevOps & Software Engineering Professional Certificate  
Final Agile Planning Project | Simulated Sprint Workflow  
Roles Played: Product Owner · Scrum Master · Developer

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates Agile planning and execution using GitHub Projects. Acting as a product owner and scrum master, I created a realistic backlog, prioritized features, managed a sprint cycle, and simulated task completion using Kanban-style workflow.

Scenario: Building a backend product catalog for an e-commerce system  
Tools: GitHub Projects, Agile Scrum, User Story Mapping, Sprint Simulation  
Outcome: Fully simulated 2-week sprint from backlog to deployment-ready

## Stakeholder Requirements (User Stories)

| Priority | Story |
|----------|-------|
| Sprint 1 | Add a product to the catalog |
| Sprint 1 | Search/filter products |
| Sprint 1 | Cloud hosting |
| Sprint 1 | Auto-deploy changes |
| Product Backlog | Update product details |
| Product Backlog | Delete product |
| Product Backlog | Like a product |
| Product Backlog | Dislike a product |
| Product Backlog | View all products |
| Icebox | Retrieve product by ID |

## Sprint Simulation

All sprint tasks moved from Sprint Backlog to In Progress, then to Review/QA, and finally to Done.

- Sprint Backlog: 4 Issues
- Product Backlog: 5 Issues
- Icebox: 1 Issue

## Agile Tools Used

- GitHub Kanban Project
- Gherkin-style acceptance criteria
- Sprint milestones and story point logic
- Backlog refinement and prioritization
- Issue tagging and column simulation
- Burndown simulation (visual only)

## What I Learned

This project gave me confidence in managing Agile planning cycles from scratch — transforming vague product ideas into structured user stories, prioritizing realistically, and simulating sprints in GitHub like a real DevOps team.
