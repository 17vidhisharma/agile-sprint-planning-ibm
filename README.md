# 🧠 Agile Sprint Planning — IBM DevOps Capstone

🎓 IBM DevOps & Software Engineering Professional Certificate  
📂 Final Agile Planning Project | Simulated Sprint Workflow  
👤 Roles Played: Product Owner · Scrum Master · Developer

## 📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates Agile planning and execution using GitHub Projects. Acting as a product owner and scrum master, I created a realistic backlog, prioritized features, managed a sprint cycle, and simulated task completion using Kanban-style workflow.

🧩 Scenario: Building a backend product catalog for an e-commerce system  
📊 Tools: GitHub Projects, Agile Scrum, User Story Mapping, Sprint Simulation  
🏁 Outcome: Fully simulated 2-week sprint from backlog to deployment-ready
